A test client for screeps using [conrod] and [rust-screeps-api].

Screeps is a true programming MMO where users uploading JavaScript code to power their online empires.

`rust-screeps-conrod` is my testbed project for creating an open source client to the screeps server which will be
usable both for the [official server][screeps] and for any [private server][screeps-os] instances run by users.
